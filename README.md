# Impact of Remote Work on Employee Mental Health

This project analyzes how remote work influences the mental health conditions of employees, utilizing the [Remote Work & Mental Health](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health) dataset from Kaggle. The analysis explores stress triggers, work-life balance, mental health status, and other demographic and behavioral factors using statistical and visual analysis in R.

## 📊 Dataset

**Source**: [Remote Work & Mental Health Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health)  
**Records**: Approximately 5,000 employees  
**Key Features**:
- Work location (remote, hybrid, onsite)
- Industry and job role
- Mental health condition
- Work-life balance, stress level, hours worked
- Physical activity, sleep quality, social isolation

## 🔍 Objectives

- Analyze how different working conditions relate to stress and mental health.
- Examine relationships between behavioral health factors (e.g., sleep, physical activity) and workplace outcomes.
- Identify patterns across demographics and job roles.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **R** with `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`
- **R Markdown** for reproducible reporting
- **Kaggle** for data sourcing

## 📌 Key Insights

- Remote workers reported slightly higher average stress than onsite workers.
- Poor sleep and low physical activity are strong predictors of reported mental health issues.
- Over 60% of employees in high-stress industries had inadequate work-life balance.
- Social isolation was significantly higher among remote employees.
