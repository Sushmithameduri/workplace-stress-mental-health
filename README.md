# Impact of Workplace Stress on Mental Health Conditions of Employees

This project explores how workplace stress impacts employees' mental health across different industries and work settings (remote, hybrid, onsite). Using a dataset of 5,000 employees, we conducted a detailed statistical analysis and created informative visualizations to uncover patterns and suggest improvements for organizational wellness.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Code.html` – Final HTML output with all analysis, visualizations, and interpretations.
- `Report.pdf` – Comprehensive written report with detailed methodology, insights, and recommendations.
- `Workplace_Stress_Analysis.Rmd` – Source R Markdown file (not committed here but used to generate the above files).
- `README.md` – Overview of the project, purpose, and structure.

## 🔍 Key Questions Addressed

- How does work location affect employee stress and mental health?
- What role do physical activity and sleep quality play in mitigating stress?
- Are there industry-specific mental health patterns?
- What is the relationship between overtime, meeting fatigue, and stress?

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **R**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`: For data manipulation and plotting
- **R Markdown**: For dynamic reporting
- **Kaggle Dataset**: As the data source

## 📊 Feature Engineering

We developed new metrics such as:
- Work-Life Balance Score
- Meeting Fatigue Score
- Physical & Mental Health Index
- Overtime Indicator
- Efficiency Score

These features helped quantify the impact of workplace factors on employee wellness.

## 📈 Key Visuals & Outputs

- Age distribution histograms
- Mental health condition breakdowns
- Stress level maps by region
- Work-life balance bar charts
- Sleep quality pie charts

## 📌 Findings

- High levels of stress are consistently reported across all work settings.
- One-third of employees report poor sleep quality.
- Overtime and meeting fatigue are significantly associated with higher stress levels.
- Remote work is associated with slightly higher stress levels compared to onsite.
